# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 340: Client / Server Development at Southern New Hampshire University. This project was completed in Python using MongoDB.

1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintainable and adaptable, I prioritize clear structure, consistent naming conventions, modular design, and inline documentation. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module that encapsulated all database operations within a reusable class. This separation of concerns made it easy to connect dashboard widgets in Project Two without rewriting logic. The modular design allowed updates or enhancements to the data retrieval process without affecting the Dash application. In the future, this CRUD module could be used in other dashboards or applications that need access to the same animal shelter database, saving time and ensuring consistency.

2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems methodically by breaking them down into smaller parts, identifying the required inputs and expected outputs, and designing solutions that meet those requirements efficiently. For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I started by understanding the clientâ€™s need for data visualization and interactive filtering, then mapped those needs to database queries and dashboard components. Compared to earlier coursework, this project required more end-to-end integration and user-focused design. Moving forward, I plan to use these learned techniques to build robust databases that align with client goals.

3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design systems and tools that solve real-world problems through technology. Our work matters because it can transform how businesses operate, make decisions, and serve their communities. In this project, the dashboard I developed for Grazioso Salvare helps the organization analyze animal shelter data quickly and visually, improving their ability to manage operations and save lives.
